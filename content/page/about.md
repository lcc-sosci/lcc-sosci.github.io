The Social Science Department is really cool. Our faculty teach courses that provide a strong foundation in the liberal arts and sciences. These include class offerings from disciplines among the traditional [social sciences](https://lowercolumbia.edu/programs/social-science.php), humanities (history and philosophy), and [criminal justice](https://lowercolumbia.edu/programs/criminal-justice.php).
